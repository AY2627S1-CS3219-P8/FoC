## Friend on Campus (FoC)

**Friend on Campus (FoC)** is a peer-to-peer campus errand platform where
students can request items to be collected from stores or facilities on
campus, and other students can fulfil (and deliver) those requests. The
platform runs on a closed credit economy — credits cannot be bought,
withdrawn, or exchanged for money, and only circulate within the platform.

## Repository Structure

This repository follows a **one-service-per-folder** structure: each
microservice (`user-service/`, `supplier-service/`, `order-service/`,
`credit-service/`) lives in its own top-level folder.

```text
.
├── user-service/
├── supplier-service/
├── order-service/
├── credit-service/
├── <n2h-service>/
└── README.md
```

- Any **nice-to-have (N2H)** feature that warrants its own service should
  be added as an **additional folder** at the same level, following the
  same per-service structure.
- Files for agentic coding tools (e.g. agent configs, prompts, skills)
  may be added as needed, but must still **respect the
  one-service-per-folder skeleton** for core implementation.

---

## Running Locally with Docker Compose

Services can be run via the root [`compose.yaml`](./compose.yaml).

Generate the local internal CA and User Service certificate once before the
first Compose start:

```powershell
.\scripts\generate-dev-tls.ps1
```

See [`docs/internal-https.md`](./docs/internal-https.md) for the internal HTTPS
trust model and production certificate guidance.

If `.env` does not exist, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure its required
credentials. Supplier startup automatically enables PostGIS, provisions its
database roles, runs migrations, and applies runtime grants before starting the
API. No manual SQL setup is needed; see the
[Supplier startup guide](supplier-service/README.md#docker-compose).

Start the services:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Rebuild after making changes:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Stop and remove the containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

- [Implemented PATCH documentation](supplier-service/ai/usage-log.md#ai-20261001-009):
  Codex (GPT-6) provided Refactoring and documentation improvements for the
  Supplier Service README. Retained changes document mounted administrator PATCH,
  version checks, complete saved/conflict examples, atomic failure behavior, and
  test coverage/prerequisites while preserving planned DELETE and administrative
  reads. Merged example validation, exact canonical response comparison, conflict
  body, test paths, summary placement, and whitespace checks passed. No application
  suite or live smoke check was rerun; prior results remain historical. Keith
  reviewed the retained README changes; no human test rerun is claimed. Exact
  prompt and final response are recorded; original timestamp unavailable, with
  no redactions or header exceptions. See the
  [Supplier Service summary](supplier-service/README.md#ai-use-summary-supplier-service).

  Codex (GPT-6) provided Writing implementation code and Refactoring and
  documentation improvements for the supplier repository/service, and Writing
  implementation code and Boilerplate generation for 31 new integration cases.
  Retained work adds refreshed row locking, version checks, write-free repeated
  deletion, preserved columns/assignments, and safe transaction failures without
  retries. Agent checks passed 88 update/deletion integration cases and 820 unit/API
  tests, with one dependency warning per suite; scoped whitespace checks passed.
  Disposable PostGIS resources were removed; broader integration suites were not
  run. Keith reviewed all three files; no human test rerun is claimed. Exact prompt
  and final response are recorded; original timestamp unavailable, with no
  redactions or header exceptions. See the
  [Supplier Service summary](supplier-service/README.md#ai-use-summary-supplier-service).

  improvements, Boilerplate generation, and Debugging assistance across the new
  administrator router, app registration, API tests, and route assertion correction.
  Retained work adds positive-version validation, empty 204 after service completion,
  safe errors, and 31 DELETE cases covering authentication, repeat deletion,
  transaction failure, cleanup, no retries, and OpenAPI. Agent checks passed
  86 focused adapter cases and all 851 unit/API tests, with one dependency warning
  per suite; whitespace checks passed. Controlled dependencies required no external
  services; PostGIS integration was not rerun for this adapter. Keith reviewed all
  four files; no human test rerun is claimed. Exact prompt and final response are
  recorded; original timestamp unavailable, with no redactions or header exceptions.
  See the [Supplier Service summary](supplier-service/README.md#ai-use-summary-supplier-service).

  anonymous active-only public reads. Agent checks passed 883 unit/API tests
  (including 91 focused read API cases) and 85 read integration tests against
  disposable PostGIS, with one dependency warning per suite; scoped whitespace
  checks passed. Initial route and working-directory errors were corrected and
  the test container removed. Broader integration suites and live authentication
  were not run. Keith reviewed all five files; no human test rerun is claimed.
  Exact prompt and final response are recorded; original timestamp unavailable,
  with no redactions or header exceptions. See the
  [Supplier Service summary](supplier-service/README.md#ai-use-summary-supplier-service).

  real DELETE/PATCH contention, complete retained state, cleanup, and seed
  reimport preservation. All 240 integration cases passed against disposable
  PostGIS, with one dependency warning; collection and whitespace checks passed.
  Test resources were removed; no requested checks remained blocked. Authentication
  was controlled, not live. Keith reviewed all three files; no human rerun is
  claimed. Exact prompt and final response are recorded; original timestamp
  unavailable, with no redactions or header exceptions. See the
  [Supplier Service summary](supplier-service/README.md#ai-use-summary-supplier-service).

  seed preservation, separate service authentication, examples, and verification
  commands. A follow-up fixed a remaining stale claim with an internal link.
  Canonical examples, OpenAPI declarations, test links, summary placement, and
  whitespace checks passed; application suites and live authentication were not
  rerun. Historical results remain historical. Keith reviewed the retained work
  and correction; no human rerun is claimed. Exact prompts and relevant responses
  are recorded; original timestamps unavailable, with no redactions or header
  exceptions. See the

  Claude Code (claude-opus-5-5) provided Boilerplate generation, Writing
  implementation code, and Debugging assistance for the new service package,
  its tests, and Notification-related root `compose.yaml` and `.env.example`
  changes. A readiness hang against a frozen database was fixed before
  retention. Agent checks: 19 tests passed, `docker compose config` succeeded
  with existing services unchanged, and live startup, readiness, and
  configuration-failure checks passed. Keith reviewed all affected
  changes; no human test rerun is claimed. Exact prompts and key responses are recorded; original
  timestamps unavailable, no redactions; header exception for

  improvements for the Notification Service README: purpose, contract assumption,
  Compose and configuration reference, an end-to-end walkthrough, API reference,
  DLQ investigation runbook, Frontend Service handover, and a single full-suite
  test command, following the user's specification. It reported an Order Service
  CA-trust bug and, at the user's choice, documented a temporary git-ignored
  Compose override instead of fixing it. A follow-up labelled every command with
  the terminal and directory to run it from. Agent checks: the walkthrough, the
  handover statuses, and the runbook were run against the local Compose stack;
  the full suite with PostgreSQL 16 and Kafka 4.1.2 had 923 passed and 0
  skipped. The follow-up's edits were only syntax-checked by the agent. Keith
  confirmed on 2026-11-09 performing all end-to-end checks and tests included in

### Ewen Low (Order Service, event broker, demo, Kubernetes)

All of Ewen's AI use in this project was through the Cursor agent. The model
identifier is not recorded in the chat history. The 35 chats below run
from 2026-09-24 to
2026-11-10 and contain 236 prompts. Each entry lists the files and
categories affected, where the output ended up, and the exact prompts with
verbatim key-response excerpts. Exchanges where the AI proposed designs or
drafted justifications are labelled **Design discussion**.

- Evidence: the Cursor chat transcripts and git history on Ewen's machine.
  Original timestamps are in UTC+8. System follow-up messages are omitted.
  Repeated identical prompts are merged and counted.
- Redactions: an SSO start URL, an email address and an AWS account ID in the
  AWS SSO chat.
- Author review: Ewen committed or merged the outputs named in each entry. No
  other review or human test rerun is recorded.
- Missing evidence: model identifiers; file-header attributions and an
  `ai/usage-log.md` for Ewen's files do not exist yet.

#### 2026-09-24: PR #4 review and first Order Service create-order work (F11.1)

- Code review (outside the course categories): reviewed PR #4 in chat, ranked the points, and explained them. Nothing was posted on GitHub.
- Writing implementation code: a first create-order Order Service in `order-service/` (app, models, routes, schemas, services, Dockerfile, tests) for F11.1.
- Boilerplate generation: Order Service entries in `compose.yaml` and `.env.example`.
- Outcome: Kept locally; superseded by the 2026-10-05 Order Service work, which became [PR #24](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS3219-P8/FoC/pull/24).

<summary>Exact prompts and key responses (10)</summary>

Prompt 1 (2026-09-24 13:39 +08:00):

```text
@/Users/a65945/Downloads/CS3219_ProjectTeam08_D1_Slides.pptx
i aim to complete F11.1 for order service only.  Pull latest.

I want you to review PR4 and write out the comments here. 1 line per point only. then complete F11.1 but do not create a PR yet.
```

Key response 1: not quoted, because the final message was progress narration. See the outcome above.

Prompt 2 (2026-09-24 13:44 +08:00):

```text
write the PR4 review in this chat, do not comment anything on github. implement plan
```

Key response 2:

> 1. Branch carries all of #3 plus a merge commit; rebase onto `main` after #3 merges so the diff is registration only.
> 2. `compose.yaml` is diffed against the old empty file, but `main` now has `frontend-service` (#5), so this will conflict.
> 3. `user-service` publishes `8080:8080` to the host, which breaks NFR12.5.2 (only gateway/frontend ports published).
> 4. Generic `POSTGRES_USER`/`POSTGRES_PASSWORD` will collide once other services add databases; prefix them (e.g. `USER_DB_*`).
> 5. `db.py` silently falls back to SQLite when `DATABASE_URL` is unset; fail fast and drop the SQLite branch.
> 6. [...]

Prompt 3 (2026-09-24 16:44 +08:00):

```text
rank the PR4 review starting with the most important from the top
```

Key response 3:

> Ranked from most important to least, based on merge risk, security, and correctness:
>
> 1. `compose.yaml` is diffed against the old empty file, but `main` now has `frontend-service` (#5), so this will conflict.
> 2. The branch carries all of #3 plus a merge commit; rebase onto `main` after #3 merges so the diff is registration only.
> 3. The 409 "User already exists" contradicts the README's rule that registration errors must not disclose account existence.
> 4. `EmailStr` has no max length but the column is `String(254)`, so an overlong email becomes a Postgres DataError (500).
> 5. [...]

Prompt 4 (2026-09-24 16:49 +08:00):

```text
"compose.yaml is diffed against the old empty file, but main now has frontend-service (#5), so this will conflict." what does this mean simply
```

Key response 4:

> PR 4 rewrote the whole `compose.yaml` from an empty file, adding only `user-db` and `user-service`. After that branch was started, PR #5 merged and `main` now already has a `frontend-service` entry in that same file.
>
> Git cannot automatically combine those two edits. Merging PR 4 will conflict, and a careless resolution can drop `frontend-service` and leave only the user-service containers.

Prompt 5 (2026-09-24 16:51 +08:00):

```text
"The 409 "User already exists" contradicts the README's rule that registration errors must not disclose account existence." what line is this
```

Key response 5:

> The 409 response is raised twice in `user-service/app/services/users.py` on the PR branch:

Prompt 6 (2026-09-24 16:57 +08:00):

```text
"user-service publishes 8080:8080 to the host, which breaks NFR12.5.2 (only gateway and frontend ports published)." explain this simply
```

Key response 6:

> In PR 4, `compose.yaml` maps the user service like this:

Prompt 7 (2026-09-24 16:57 +08:00):

```text
which line is this
```

Key response 7:

> In PR 4's `compose.yaml`, the host mapping is lines 22–23:

Prompt 8 (2026-09-24 17:02 +08:00):

```text
summarise the merge conflicts as 1 line points
```

Key response 8:

> 1. `compose.yaml` conflicts because PR 4 fills the old empty file with `user-db` and `user-service`, while `main` already added `frontend-service` in that same file.
> 2. If PR #3 merges first, PR 4 conflicts again on the shared scaffold files (`compose.yaml`, `.gitignore`, `user-service` Dockerfile, README, app, and CI), because those commits are already inside PR 4.
> 3. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` conflicts if open PR #2 merges first, because both PRs add that file.

Prompt 9 (2026-09-24 17:04 +08:00):

```text
what is the suggestion to fix the conflicts? 1 line
```

Key response 9:

> Rebase `fr5-account-creation` onto current `main` after #3 merges, drop the duplicated scaffold commits, and add the user-service entries next to `frontend-service` instead of replacing `compose.yaml`.

Prompt 10 (2026-09-24 17:06 +08:00):

```text
"add the user-service entries next to frontend-service instead of replacing compose.yaml." explain simply
```

Key response 10:

> `compose.yaml` on `main` already lists `frontend-service`. PR 4 was written when that file was empty, so its version contains only `user-db` and `user-service`. Merging that version as-is would wipe out `frontend-service`. The fix is to keep `frontend-service` and add the user-service blocks underneath it in the same file.

```

Key response 2:

> [PR 11](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS3219-P8/FoC/pull/11) — **fr7 view and update profile information** — is not ready to merge. The profile, deactivation, and reactivation behavior is in good shape and well tested. Two security and concurrency issues should be fixed first, and the description does not match the diff.

Prompt 3 (2026-09-28 11:54 +08:00):

```text
"Login holds a row lock across work that does not belong there. login_user does SELECT … FOR UPDATE, then runs Argon2, and on success calls cleanup_sessions, which deletes revoked and expired sessions for every user. That global delete already runs hourly in user-service/app/main.py. Doing it inside login keeps the user row locked for the whole hash, and two logins can deadlock on the same session-row delete. Verify the password first, then lock and re-read the row before inserting the session. Leave cleanup on the existing loop. The new tests use SQLite, which ignores FOR UPDATE, so this race is not actually covered."

#### 2026-10-05: Order Service implementation on RabbitMQ

- Writing implementation code: Order Service API, worker, outbox, RabbitMQ messaging, Alembic baseline migration and tests in `order-service/`, from Ewen's request and the team's D1 requirements. The AI drafted the plan, and Ewen approved it before implementation.
- Boilerplate generation: `order-service/Dockerfile`, `alembic.ini`, `alembic/env.py`, `compose.yaml`, `.env.example`, `.github/workflows/compose.yml` and `.github/workflows/order-service.yml`.
- Refactoring and documentation improvements: `order-service/README.md` and the diagram `order-service/docs/how-it-works.pdf`.
- Outcome: Opened as [PR #24](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS3219-P8/FoC/pull/24), after one PR was opened on the template repo by mistake. Ewen then had the tests removed from the PR.

#### 2026-10-18 to 2026-10-19: Event ordering issues, plan discussion and flow diagrams

- Design discussion: the AI analysed Ewen's two event-ordering issues and drafted a fix plan (`~/.cursor/plans/event_ordering_fixes_3797b690.plan.md`, outside the repo). Ewen revised it several times, settling on one worker and one queue with each service handling its own issues. The AI evaluated that approach and suggested one-line fixes for the Credit Service owner.
- Learning support: Order DB, outbox, events vs orders, row locks, and concurrent accepts.
- Refactoring and documentation improvements: generated slide diagrams (event flow, example flow, order body, errand timeline, invariants, edge cases) as images outside the repo.
- Outcome: The plan was not implemented in this chat. The diagrams were used for slides; no repo file changed.

<details>
<summary>Exact prompts and key responses (59)</summary>

Prompt 1 (2026-10-18 15:27 +08:00):

```text
for event ordering, there are a few issues:

- For example if user service's create account event arrives, then immediately an order service place order arrives, credit service may falsely reject this order if the initial credit allocation is still being processed.

- rabbitmq retries event without adjusting their orders? So if a cancel order arrives before a create order, right now it retries the cancel order and fails until the maximum number of retries, then move on to create order.

solve these issues, then prepare event broker RabbitMQ for any more edge cases that might happen with the least over-engineering

> **The problems**
> - **Account race:** if an order arrives before the user's credit account exists, Credit rejects it with "account not found".
> - **Cancel before create:** Credit retries the cancel in place until it gives up, and the queue behind it waits the whole time.
> - **Extra bug found:** Credit treats `order.opened`, `order.accepted` and `order.picked_up` as bad messages and sends them to its dead-letter queue for every order.

Prompt 4 (2026-10-18 15:35 +08:00):

```text

```

Key response 4:

> I've rewritten the plan so it changes only Order Service and its RabbitMQ queues. Credit Service stays untouched, so both issues are fixed by controlling what Order Service sends Credit and when.
>
> - **Account race:** if Credit rejects an order because the account doesn't exist yet, Order Service keeps the order pending and asks again after about 2 seconds. It gives up after 5 tries (about 10 seconds) and then rejects the order. The re-send goes through a new delay queue that delivers only to Credit's queue. [...]

Key response 5:

> **Issue 1: an order arrives before the credit account exists**
> - When Credit replies "account not found", Order Service keeps the order pending instead of rejecting it.
> - It re-sends `order.created` with a new event id through a 2-second delay queue that delivers only to Credit.
> - A new `credit_request_attempts` column caps this at 5 tries, about 10 seconds, after which the order is rejected as today.
> - Credit needs no changes: it treats the re-send as a new request and still reserves at most once per order.

```

Key response 9:

> **Short answers:**
> - **Issue 1:** there is no efficient fix inside Order Service alone. The clean fix is a small change in Credit.
> - **Issue 2:** Credit gets "release this hold" for a hold that was never placed, errors, and retries until it gives up, blocking the queue meanwhile.

```text
what if the user is fake and is not pending but does not exist?
```

Key response 12:

> A fake user can't reach Credit through the normal flow. Order Service checks every create with User Service (`GET /users/me` with the bearer token), and the requester id comes from that session, never from the request body. No real session means a 401 and no order, so there is no `order.created` and no account gets created.

> The Credit-side fix:
> - When a release arrives and no hold exists, Credit records the order as released and acks the message. It doesn't throw an error.
> - If that order's `order.created` arrives later, Credit sees the order is already released and doesn't place a hold.

>
> - **It's simple.** One consumer per queue processes messages in the order they were published, so you don't have to reason about events being reordered or delayed.

currently, is there an "order service" module that handles order related actions (like rejection and checking) before it goes into event broker?
```

Key response 17:

> Yes. In your diagram that's the "Request Order (producer)" box, and it's the Order Service API. Every order action is checked and rejected there before anything reaches RabbitMQ. All of this lives in `order-service/app/services/orders.py`.
>
> **Checks before an event is created:**
> - **Who the caller is.** Every request is checked with User Service (`GET /users/me`). A bad session gets 401, and the requester id comes from the session, never from the request body. [...]

Prompt 18 (2026-10-18 16:36 +08:00):

```text
for issue 1, could we check if user and credit account exists in the order module before we send it to event queue? if rejected, it sends order. cancelled to the queue with reason
```

Key response 18:

> You could, but it wouldn't fix issue 1, and sending `order.cancelled` would make things worse.
>
> **Why the check doesn't fix the race:**
> - Issue 1 happens in the first moment after sign-up, before Credit has processed `user.created`.
> - A check from Order Service in that moment finds no credit account either, so the order is still falsely rejected. It's just rejected earlier, over HTTP instead of through an event.
> - The only way to pass would be to wait and check again, which is the retry approach you wanted to avoid.

```

Key response 20:

> No. Checking the user is already done, and checking the credit account doesn't solve issue 1.
>
> - **The user check already exists.** Every order request is verified with User Service, so a missing or inactive user is rejected before any event is sent. Nothing needs to change there.
> - **The credit account check fails at exactly the wrong moment.** Issue 1 happens right after sign-up, before Credit has set up the account, so the check would wrongly reject the same orders.
> - **It makes ordering depend on Credit being up.** If Credit is down, nobody can create an order. [...]

Key response 22:

>
> **On issue 1:** if rejecting the order is the behaviour you want, issue 1 is no longer a bug, and you don't need any new code for it. This already works:
> 1. `order.created` reaches Credit before the account exists.
> 2. Credit's `reserve_credits` rejects it with reason `ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND` and publishes `credit.reservation_failed`.
> 3. Order Service sets the order to `REJECTED` and stores the reason in `rejection_reason`.

Key response 23:

is it better to validate credit service credits with user service and supplier service at the order api or with the current approach?

Key response 40:

> The current approach (asking Credit through an event) is better. The reason is the difference between reading data and changing it.
>
> **Why User and Supplier can be checked over HTTP:** these checks only read data that rarely changes, such as "is this session valid?" and "is this store active?". Nothing is reserved, so reading them during the request is safe.

rabbitmq retries event without adjusting their orders? So if a cancel order arrives before a create order, right now it retries the cancel order and fails until the maximum number of retries, then move on to create order.

Key response 1:

> The order service is a FastAPI + PostgreSQL REST API for a campus errand marketplace. Requesters post errands with a credit reward, and couriers accept and deliver them. Leaving out the RabbitMQ part, here is what it does:
>
> - **Create errand** (`POST /orders`): saves a new order with pickup supplier, delivery location, item description and credit amount, starting at status `PENDING_CREDIT`.
> - **Idempotent create**: needs an `Idempotency-Key` header. Re-sending the same request returns the original order (200), and reusing the key with a different body returns 409. [...]

Key response 2:

> Any caller holding a valid user login token can use the endpoints, not just the frontend. The order service never checks who the caller is (browser, curl or another service); it only checks the bearer token.
>
> **How access works:**
> - Every `/orders` endpoint needs an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. The order service sends that token to the User Service (`/users/me`) to find out who the caller is.
> - Permissions depend on the user's role (`user` or `admin`) and on how they relate to the order (requester or assigned courier). They don't depend on which app sent the request. [...]

#### 2026-10-19 to 2026-10-21: Lecture alignment, move to Kafka, event broker, slides and D3 answers

- Design discussion: compared the implementation with the lecture slides and, when asked, proposed architecture changes including moving from RabbitMQ to Kafka.
- Writing implementation code: switched the Order Service to Kafka in `order-service/app/events.py`, `messaging.py`, `worker.py`, `services/orders.py` and `requirements.txt`, and created `event-broker/compose.yaml` and `event-broker/create-topics.sh`. The AI drafted the plan, and Ewen approved it.
- Boilerplate generation: root `compose.yaml` `include:`, `.env.example` and `.github/workflows/compose.yml`.
- Refactoring and documentation improvements: `event-broker/README.md`, `order-service/README.md`, `order-service/docs/event-driven-order-flow.pptx` (including the asynchronous workflow slide), and `order-service/docs/d3-part1-part3-answers.pdf`, which drafted the answers to D3 Parts 1 and 3.
- Learning support: Alembic, Kafka, idempotency keys, conflicting actions and status enforcement.
- Outcome: Code pushed to PR #24, then split into [PR #27](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS3219-P8/FoC/pull/27) (event broker); both are merged. `event-driven-order-flow.pptx` is on `main`; `d3-part1-part3-answers.pdf` is local only.

<summary>Exact prompts and key responses (26)</summary>

Prompt 1 (2026-10-19 16:35 +08:00):

```text
is what is currently implemented consisten with what is in this lecture?
```

Key response 1:

> **Mostly yes, with two real departures.** The order service follows the lecture's main event-driven ideas: events are past-tense facts, publishing is asynchronous, each service owns its own data, and choreography is driven by events. It departs from the lecture in two places:

Prompt 2 (2026-10-19 17:13 +08:00):

```text
if you were to change the current order service architecture to align with the lecture slides, what will you do?
```

Key response 2:

> I'd make four changes, in priority order. They remove the two departures from the lecture and close the two partial gaps: switch to a replayable, partitioned log, stop the producer from knowing its consumers, carry more data in events, and replace the synchronous Supplier check with a local copy. I'd keep the outbox, idempotency handling and event contract as they are, since they already match the lecture.

Prompt 3 (2026-10-19 17:21 +08:00):

```text
how would order service know credit_amount in the event before sending the event to credit service?
```

Key response 3:

> The requester sets the amount when they create the order. `credit_amount` is a required field in the `POST /orders` body. It's the reward the requester offers the courier for the errand, so the order service never has to ask Credit for it.

Prompt 4 (2026-10-19 17:23 +08:00):

```text
update these slides to reflect the proposed changes
```

Key response 4:

> I've recreated both slides with the proposed changes as a new two-slide deck, `order-service/docs/event-driven-order-flow.pptx`. Your screenshots aren't in the repo, so I couldn't edit the originals. Instead I rebuilt them as editable PowerPoint shapes in the same teal style, and each carries a "PROPOSED" tag because the code still uses RabbitMQ. I exported both slides through Keynote to check the layout; that's where the previews below come from.

Prompt 5 (2026-10-19 17:29 +08:00):

```text
why is supplier service not validated together with user service?
```

Key response 5:

> In the current code they are validated together: `create_order` calls the User Service and the Supplier Service while handling the request. They're split only in the proposed slides. The reason is that the two checks need different freshness, so the lecture's advice to avoid synchronous coupling suits one check and not the other.

Prompt 6 (2026-10-19 17:32 +08:00):

```text
- move supplier service beside user service when order api is validating, it should be checked together with user service
- remove +supplier copy in order DB, the 3 boxes below, worker description, supplier.events, and any description in event broker except (Kafka)
- make sure notification service has a way of updating the frontend also
```

Key response 6: none recorded; the request was interrupted or re-sent.

Prompt 7 (2026-10-19 17:33 +08:00):

```text
First slide:
- move supplier service beside user service when order api is validating, it should be checked together with user service
- remove +supplier copy in order DB, the 3 boxes below, worker description, supplier.events, and any description in event broker except (Kafka)
- make sure notification service has a way of updating the frontend also

second slide:
- remove the "proposed" and descriptor
- remove the words underneath each box, and space the lines out so its more readable
```

Key response 7:

> I've made all the changes, rebuilt `order-service/docs/event-driven-order-flow.pptx`, and checked both slides through a Keynote export.
>
> ![Event-Driven Order Flow](/tmp/foc_slides/out/out.001.png)
>
> **Slide 1, Event-Driven Order Flow:**
> - **Validation:** Supplier Service now sits next to User Service above the Order API. Both have grey synchronous arrows into the API, under one "validate (sync)" label.
> - **Removed:** "+ supplier copy" in the Order DB, the three explanation cards at the bottom, the Worker's sub-labels, the `supplier.events` topic and the Supplier Service on the right. [...]

Prompt 8 (2026-10-19 17:45 +08:00):

```text
implement order service and event broker

- do not implement notification service or credit service, or user/supplier service
- only make changes to order service, and event broker
- create a new directory "event broker" alongside the service directories and implement any code related to event broker there
- make minimal changes and do not over engineer, make sure the code is cleanly seperated by context
```

Key response 8: not quoted, because the final message was progress narration. See the outcome above.

Prompt 9 (2026-10-19 17:51 +08:00):

```text
does the proposed plan mirror the images?
```

Key response 9:

> Yes, for everything in scope. Each part of both slides that touches the Order Service or the broker has a matching step in the plan. Notification Service and its "status updates" path to the Frontend are drawn but not built, because you excluded those services. The plan also adds two things the slides don't show, and one header that differs slightly.

Prompt 10 (2026-10-19 17:53 +08:00):

```text
so does event_id send alongside event_type?
```

Key response 10:

> In the plan, yes: `event_id` would go out as a second Kafka header next to `event_type`. The slide shows only `event_type` in the headers. Either way, `event_id` is always in the message value, because it's part of the event envelope:

Prompt 11 (2026-10-19 17:54 +08:00):

```text
Kafka event broker for Order Service

Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan file itself.

To-do's from the plan have already been created. Do not create them again. Mark them as in_progress as you work, starting with the first one. Don't stop until you have completed all the to-dos.
```

Key response 11:

> Order Service now publishes and consumes through Kafka. RabbitMQ is gone. The API still never talks to the broker: each status change and its event commit together, and the worker delivers the event afterwards.
>
> **Event broker.** `event-broker/` runs a single Kafka node at `kafka:9092` and a one-shot job that creates the topics. `order.events` and `credit.events` have 3 partitions and are kept indefinitely. `order-service.credit-events.dlq` holds credit messages the worker cannot apply. Nothing in Notification, Credit, User, or Supplier Service was changed.

Prompt 12 (2026-10-19 18:12 +08:00):

Key response 12: none recorded; the request was interrupted or re-sent.

Prompt 13 (2026-10-19 18:12 +08:00):

```text
answer in 1 line each

- whats alembic
- how does kafka work here
- is notification service built
- were any services apart from event broker/order service modified
```

Key response 13:

> Alembic is the tool that creates and updates the Order Service's Postgres tables from the migration files in `order-service/alembic/versions/`.
>
> Kafka is the broker: the worker publishes order events to `order.events` and consumes credit events from `credit.events`, while the API only writes the order and its event into Postgres.

Prompt 14 (2026-10-19 18:13 +08:00):

```text
push to PR 24, make sure it has the latest code
```

Key response 14:

> PR 24 is up to date with the Kafka changes at commit `5178c7b`: https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS3219-P8/FoC/pull/24
>
> The commit includes the event broker, the Order Service worker changes, and the slides in `order-service/docs`. The local `.cursor/` folder was left untracked. The PR title still says "RabbitMQ outbox".

Prompt 15 (2026-10-19 18:17 +08:00):

```text
create 3 slides:
- 1 for event broker
- 1 for worker
- 1 for orderDB + outbox

make it simple, brief, short, easy to read and understand. do not need a lot of words
```

Key response 15:

> If the frontend resends the same order request with the same `Idempotency-Key`, the Order Service returns the original order with a 200 and writes nothing new. No second event is created.
>
> The Order Service never sends a "credit reservation" event. It publishes `order.created`, and Credit Service reserves the credits when it reads that event.

Prompt 16 (2026-10-19 21:29 +08:00):

```text
whats Idempotency-Key?
```

Key response 16:

> `Idempotency-Key` is an HTTP header the frontend sends with `POST /orders`. Its value is a unique ID that the frontend makes up for each order attempt, usually a UUID. It lets the server recognise a repeated request so that a retry doesn't create a second order.

Prompt 17 (2026-10-19 21:31 +08:00):

```text
what about two http with different keys but same actions to the same order, or conflicting actions to the same order
```

Key response 17:

> The `Idempotency-Key` is only used when creating an order. Accept, pickup, complete, cancel and change-delivery ignore it, so it makes no difference whether two action requests carry the same key, different keys or none.
>
> What protects an existing order is that every action first locks the order's database row. A second request for the same order waits until the first one has finished and saved its change. It then checks the order's new status and decides from that.

Prompt 18 (2026-10-19 21:35 +08:00):

```text
1 line
- any conflicting actions to orders (double order accept from frontend, accept order after cancel) how does order service handle it
```

Key response 18:

> The Order Service locks the order row, so the first action wins and the later one gets a 409 or 404 with no event (a double accept by the same courier just returns the order with a 200; accept after cancel is rejected).

Prompt 19 (2026-10-19 21:38 +08:00):

```text
1 line. how is this checked/rejected
```

Key response 19:

> Each action first runs `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` (`_lock` in `services/orders.py`), then checks the order's current status and courier or requester (for example, accept requires `status == "OPEN"`); if the check fails, `_illegal()` raises an HTTP 409, or a 403 or 404 for permission or visibility.

Prompt 20 (2026-10-19 21:40 +08:00):

```text
how is order enforced. how to register illegal actions to know what to raise
```

Key response 20:

> There is no central list of legal transitions. Each action function in `order-service/app/services/orders.py` checks the order's current status itself, and the row lock means only one action can run those checks on an order at a time.
>
> The intended flow is PENDING_CREDIT → OPEN → ACCEPTED → PICKED_UP → COMPLETED. CANCELLED, EXPIRED and REJECTED are side exits. Every action follows the same three steps:

Prompt 21 (2026-10-19 21:47 +08:00):

```text
i send 2 actions, accepted then pickup in that order. but pickup arrives first, then accept. how is this avoided?
```

Key response 21:

> Nothing on the server reorders them: the early pickup is rejected and the accept then succeeds normally. The fix belongs in the frontend.
>
> **What happens when pickup arrives first:**
>
> 1. **Pickup arrives** while the order is still OPEN with no courier. `_lock_visible` checks `_can_view`, which only lets an admin, the requester or the assigned courier see the order. This courier isn't assigned yet, so the request gets a **404** before the status check even runs. Nothing changes and no event is written.
> 2. [...]

Prompt 22 (2026-10-19 21:50 +08:00):

```text
so the component responsible for checking legal order status changes and enforcing correct ordering is the db?
```

Key response 22:

> No. The rules about which status changes are legal live in the Order Service's Python code, in `order-service/app/services/orders.py`. The database does three supporting jobs:
>
> - **Row lock.** `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` means only one request at a time can change a given order. A second request waits, then sees the latest status.
> - **Atomic commit.** The status change and its outbox event are saved together, or not at all.
> - **Basic checks on stored values.** `ck_orders_status` only allows known status names in the column. [...]

Prompt 23 (2026-10-19 21:51 +08:00):

```text
what component is this
```

Key response 23:

> It's the **Order API**, the FastAPI app in the `order-service` container (the "Order API" box on the architecture slide). Within it, the status rules live in the service layer: each action function in `order-service/app/services/orders.py` checks the current status and who is asking.

Prompt 24 (2026-10-19 21:52 +08:00):

```text
does the current implementation address all D3 requirements?
```

Key response 24:

> No. The Order Service, the Kafka event flow and the Order containers cover most of their parts of the D3 brief, but the Credit Service is empty, so Part 2 and the credit side of the integration demo are missing.

Prompt 25 (2026-10-19 21:55 +08:00):

```text
create a PDF to address all points/questions in part 1 and part 3. write the questions/points directly and the respective answers below in 1.2.3. format. make the answers simple, short, and easy to understand
```

Key response 25:

> I've created the PDF at `order-service/docs/d3-part1-part3-answers.pdf` (8 pages). It lists every Part 1 and Part 3 question from the D3 brief word for word, numbered 1.1, 1.3.1 and so on, with a short bullet-point answer under each.

```text
create a slide for Asynchronous and Event-Driven Workflow. keep it simple and easy to read
```

Key response 26:

> I've added the slide as slide 6 of `order-service/docs/event-driven-order-flow.pptx`, and it renders cleanly in Keynote. The first five slides are unchanged.

> ![Asynchronous and Event-Driven Workflow slide](/tmp/foc_slides/out6/out/out.006.png)

> The slide shows the credit flow as three boxes: Order Service sends `order.created` through Kafka to Credit Service, and `credit.reserved` comes back the same way. One sentence underneath says the requester gets a 201 straight away and the order opens once Credit replies. [...]

Key response 1:

<summary>Exact prompts and key responses (3)</summary>

Prompt 1 (2026-10-20 21:45 +08:00):

```text
create a slide for N2H 4 - Kubernetes deployment and automated scaling. make it simple and brief and easy to read
```

Key response 1:

> I made the slide and saved it at `docs/n2h-4-kubernetes.pptx`. It uses the same cream-and-teal D3 style as `order-service.pptx`.
>
> ![N2H 4 slide preview](/tmp/n2hprev/v2.pptx.png)

> - **How it fits together:** a simple diagram. [...]

Prompt 2 (2026-10-20 21:53 +08:00):

```text
is aws lambda a good autoscaler?
1 line why it is
```

Key response 2:

> Lambda isn't really an autoscaler. It's serverless compute that scales itself, running one copy per request and dropping to zero when idle, so you never set scaling rules. It's a poor fit for FoC, though, because the Order and Credit workers are long-running Kafka consumers, and Lambda works best for short, stateless requests. On the slide, Kubernetes' built-in Horizontal Pod Autoscaler is the right fit.

Prompt 3 (2026-10-20 21:54 +08:00):

```text
what is the best autoscaler and why? 1 line
```

Key response 3:

> For FoC, the best choice is **KEDA**, Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling. It runs on top of Kubernetes' built-in Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and scales the Order and Credit workers by Kafka consumer lag, meaning how many messages are waiting, which shows real demand better than CPU does. One limit: a service can't usefully have more copies than its topic has partitions.

```text
come up with the most common edge cases and solutions for order service and the event driven architecture. write the problem 1 line, solution 1 line. easy to read and understand
```

Key response 1:

> These are the most common edge cases for the order service and the event-driven flow between Order Service and Credit Service over Kafka. Most of them are already handled in your code.

Prompt 2 (2026-10-21 21:11 +08:00):

```text
answer all in 1 line from this conversation forwards
```

Key response 2:

> Got it: from now on, every answer will be one line.

Prompt 3 (2026-10-21 21:14 +08:00):

```text
i still dont get how order api checks user and supplier service if its just an api
```

Key response 3:

> The Order API is also an HTTP client: during each request, `app/clients.py` calls the User Service at `GET /users/me` with the caller's bearer token to find out who the caller is, then calls the Supplier Service at `GET /suppliers/{id}` to confirm the pickup location exists, and only creates the order if both answers are OK.

Prompt 4 (2026-10-21 21:16 +08:00):

```text
is there a queue before order db + outbox
```

Key response 4:

> No: the API writes the order and its outbox row straight to the database in one transaction during the HTTP request, and Kafka only comes in after that, when the worker relays outbox rows out to `order.events`.

Prompt 5 (2026-10-21 21:16 +08:00):

```text
so if there are multiple HTTP requests what happens
```

Key response 5:

> Each request runs in parallel with its own database transaction, and the database keeps them safe: different orders never clash, the idempotency key's unique constraint stops duplicate creates, and row locks (`FOR UPDATE`) make conflicting actions on the same order, like two accepts, wait their turn so only the first succeeds.

Prompt 6 (2026-10-21 21:18 +08:00):

```text
so what happens if Two couriers accept the same order at once.
```

Key response 6:

> Both requests try to lock the order row (`_lock` uses `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`), so the first courier gets the lock, sets the order to `ACCEPTED` with themselves as courier, and commits, then the second courier's request continues, sees the order is already `ACCEPTED` by someone else, and gets a 409 Conflict telling them they lost (`accept_order` in `order-service/app/services/orders.py`).

Prompt 7 (2026-10-21 21:19 +08:00):

```text
the API goes directly straight to the DB?
```

Key response 7:

> Yes: the FastAPI route calls the service function, which uses a SQLAlchemy session to read and write Postgres directly in that same request, with no queue or broker in between, and the only outside calls it makes first are the HTTP checks to the User and Supplier services.

Prompt 8 (2026-10-21 21:19 +08:00):

```text
so where is the API waiting when it checks user and supplier
```

Key response 8:

> It waits inside the request itself: the routes are plain `def`, so FastAPI runs each one on a threadpool thread, and that thread blocks on the `httpx` call to the User or Supplier service until it gets a reply or hits the 3-second timeout (`HTTP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`), which becomes a 503, while other requests keep running on other threads.

Prompt 9 (2026-10-21 21:28 +08:00):

```text
so the API waits on the main thread, while it spawns 2 side threads to check user and supplier service while the main thread waits?
```

Key response 9:

> No: each request runs on a single threadpool thread, and that same thread calls the User Service and then the Supplier Service one after the other with no extra threads, while the main event-loop thread never waits and just keeps accepting new requests.

Prompt 10 (2026-10-21 21:29 +08:00):

```text
so 1 HTTP request 1 thread, and it sends message requests to user and supplier while that 1 thread waits?
```

Key response 10:

> Yes, one request gets one thread, but these are plain HTTP calls rather than messages, and they happen one at a time: the thread calls the User Service, waits for the reply, then calls the Supplier Service and waits again before writing to the database.

Prompt 11 (2026-10-21 21:29 +08:00):

```text
explain very clearly how this works
```

Key response 11:

> When a create-order request arrives, FastAPI hands it to one free worker thread, which sends an HTTP call to the User Service to check the token and waits up to 3 seconds for the reply, then sends an HTTP call to the Supplier Service to check the pickup location and waits again, then saves the order and its outbox event to Postgres in one transaction and returns the response, while other requests run the same steps on other threads.

Prompt 12 (2026-10-21 21:51 +08:00):

```text
how does worker work
```

Key response 12:

> The worker in `order-service/app/worker.py` is a separate process that runs one endless loop doing three jobs in turn: it polls `credit.events` and applies each message to the order (retrying a few times, then sending it to the DLQ if it still fails, and committing the offset either way), then publishes unsent outbox rows to `order.events` in id order and marks each one sent, then periodically expires orders that are past their `expires_at`.

why choose kafka? 1 line

Key response 14:

> Kafka keeps every event in a durable log that can be replayed (retention is set to never delete), keeps each order's events in order by keying them on `order_id`, and lets both Credit and Notification read the same `order.events` stream independently at their own pace, which a simple job queue like RabbitMQ or SQS doesn't do as naturally.

#### 2026-10-22: Worker crash when the DLQ is unavailable

- Debugging assistance: assessed a reviewer's comment on DLQ failures and explained the problem.
- Writing implementation code: kept the worker alive when a DLQ publish fails (`order-service/app/worker.py`, commit `8b9ff20`). Following Ewen's requirement that a bad message must not block good ones, it added parking in Postgres (`order-service/app/worker.py`, `order-service/app/models.py`, `order-service/alembic/versions/20261022_0002_parked_messages.py`, `order-service/README.md`, commit `63aa98e`).
- Outcome: Pushed to PR #24, which is merged.

"""
When Kafka is down or slow:

A message gets nacked and dead_letter is called.
The DLQ send isn't acknowledged within 10s, so RuntimeError is raised and main() exits. The worker container dies.
Until Docker restarts it, everything the worker does stops: no outbox events are sent, no credit messages are processed, and no expiry sweep runs.
On restart, the offset was never committed, so the same message is processed again. That means another ~7.5s of retries and another DLQ attempt.
If Kafka is still unhealthy, the worker gets stuck in a crash loop.

```

Key response 1:

> If Kafka is down or slow, the DLQ publish times out after 10s and the `RuntimeError` it raises kills the worker; the offset is never committed, so the restarted worker reprocesses the same message and crash-loops, which is why the comment suggests wrapping `publisher.dead_letter` in a try/except.

```text
is this valid? be objective
```

Key response 2:

> The facts in the comment are accurate, and the risk is real but narrower than it sounds. The suggested fix is also wrong if it's done naively: a bare try/except here turns a crash into silent message loss.
>
> **What the comment gets right**
>
> - `dead_letter` calls `_require_delivery`. That flushes for 10s and raises `KafkaException` or `RuntimeError` if the send isn't acknowledged. In `_handle_message` nothing catches it, so it goes up through `main()` and the process exits. The relay and the expiry sweep catch their own errors, but this path doesn't. [...]

```text
i dont understand. explain simply in 1 line
```

Key response 3:

> The comment is partly right: the worker can crash and restart over and over, but only when a bad message can't be sent to the DLQ. And just catching the error would quietly lose that message, so the fix should keep it and retry later.

Prompt 4 (2026-10-22 11:45 +08:00):

```text
i dont understand the problem
```

Key response 4:

> Here's the problem in plain steps:
>
> 1. The worker reads a message from Kafka and tries to save it to the database. It fails 5 times, maybe because the message is broken.
> 2. So the worker tries to set the message aside by sending it to the "failed messages" topic (the DLQ).
> 3. If Kafka doesn't answer within 10 seconds, that send throws an error. Nothing catches it, so the whole worker crashes.
> 4. While the worker is down, its other jobs stop too: sending order events and expiring old orders.
> 5. Docker restarts the worker. [...]

Prompt 5 (2026-10-22 11:46 +08:00):

```text
the DLQ is in kafka?
```

Key response 5:

> Yes. The DLQ is just another Kafka topic, `order-service.credit-events.dlq`. It's created in `event-broker/create-topics.sh` and set in `order-service/app/messaging.py` (line 7).
>
> That's the core of the problem. When Kafka is unhealthy, the DLQ is unhealthy too, because it's the same Kafka. The worker's fallback for bad messages depends on the very system that's failing, so instead of setting the message aside, the worker crashes.

Prompt 7 (2026-10-22 11:50 +08:00):

```text
will the bad message block the other good messages from reaching the worker?
```

Key response 7:

> Partly. The bad message blocks the good messages behind it in the same partition, and it slows down the rest. This only lasts while the DLQ send keeps failing.
>
> **Same partition: blocked.** `credit.events` has 3 partitions (see `event-broker/create-topics.sh`, line 18). Kafka hands out each partition's messages in order. `seek` rewinds that partition to the bad message, so the good messages after it there wait until the bad one gets through. That's roughly a third of the traffic.

Prompt 8 (2026-10-22 11:54 +08:00):

```text
cant i keep the bad message somewhere instead of blocking the good messages in the same partition? also what partition is that?
```

Key response 8:

> **Which partition?** Credit Service sends each `credit.events` message with the `order_id` as its key, as listed in `event-broker/README.md` (line 10). Kafka hashes that key to choose one of the 3 partitions. So every message about one order lands in the same partition, and that partition is also shared with roughly a third of all other orders. The partition is never set by hand; it depends on whichever order the bad message belongs to.

Prompt 9 (2026-10-22 11:55 +08:00):

```text
so if my credit.events message is bad, other good credit.events messages cant get through?
```

Key response 9:

> No, not normally. Good messages only get stuck when a bad message arrives and Kafka can't accept it into the DLQ at the same time.
>
> **Normal case (Kafka healthy):**
> 1. A bad `credit.events` message fails 5 times, which takes about 7.5 seconds.
> 2. The worker sends it to the DLQ, which works.
> 3. The worker marks it as done and moves on. Good messages are only delayed by those few seconds.

Prompt 10 (2026-10-22 11:56 +08:00):

```text
i want to find a way when bad message and DLQ send fails, the bad message does not block good messages from the worker

Key response 10:

> To do this, keep the bad message in the order-service's Postgres database instead of rewinding Kafka. Postgres is separate from Kafka, so it's usually still working when Kafka is down. Once the message is saved, the worker can mark it as done in Kafka and move on to the good messages.

Prompt 1 (2026-10-22 12:01 +08:00):

```text
how does state transition enforcement work?
```

Key response 1:

> The rules live entirely in the service layer, `app/services/orders.py`, and there is no central transition table. Each action function locks the order row, checks who is calling, checks the current status, and then writes the new status in the same database transaction as its outbox event. The database itself only checks that `status` is one of the eight known values (`ck_orders_status` in `app/models.py`); it doesn't check which status can follow which.

```text
1 line
```

Key response 2:

> Each action function in `app/services/orders.py` locks the order row, checks who is calling and the current status, and returns 409 through `_illegal` on a bad transition, while the Kafka and expiry handlers just skip transitions that don't apply.

Key response 3:

> Each button that changes an order first checks whether the order is in the right state for it.
>
> For example, "pick up" only works if the order is currently `ACCEPTED`. If it's anything else, like still `OPEN` or already `COMPLETED`, the request is refused with a "Cannot pick up an order with status …" error (HTTP 409).

Key response 1:

> **Request changes.** [PR 33](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS3219-P8/FoC/pull/33) wires the feed, request form, errand list, and credits page to Order Service and Credit Service carefully, but a few user-facing paths do not match the services or the mobile layout. No CI checks ran on `frontend-order-credit-integration`.

#### 2026-11-03: Local Kubernetes (kind) deployment

- Boilerplate generation: Kustomize manifests in `deploy/k8s/` (apps, data, jobs, demo, seed, tools, `kind-config.yaml`), and `scripts/k8s-up.sh` and `scripts/k8s-down.sh`. The AI drafted the plan, and Ewen approved it.
- Refactoring and documentation improvements: the "Running on Kubernetes (kind)" section of `README.md`.
- Learning support: one-line overviews of the Kubernetes architecture.
- Outcome: Opened as [PR #35](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS3219-P8/FoC/pull/35), still open.

Key response 2:

>
> The panel draws Frontend, Order API, Order DB and its outbox, the worker, Kafka, and Credit Service. Notification Service stays dashed and labeled "not built". Inside the broker, `order.events` and `credit.events` are three partition rows each. A cell is one record.

#### 2026-11-08: Courier cancellation and order status history

- Learning support: how expiry works and whether couriers could cancel.
- Writing implementation code: courier cancellation (reopening the order) and an `order_status_history` table in `order-service/app/models.py`, `routes/orders.py`, `schemas.py`, `services/orders.py` and `order-service/alembic/versions/20261108_0003_order_status_history.py`, with a pytest suite (`order-service/tests/`, `pytest.ini`, `requirements-dev.txt`). The AI drafted the plan, and Ewen approved it.
- Refactoring and documentation improvements: `order-service/README.md`, `contracts/asyncapi.yaml` and `contracts/README.md`. It also updated `credit-service/tests/test_worker.py` and `demo-console/app/static/broker.js`.
- Outcome: Opened as [PR #37](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS3219-P8/FoC/pull/37), now closed; the work is on Ewen's local branch, not on `main`.

Key response 1:

> **Only `PENDING_CREDIT` and `OPEN` orders expire, one hour after creation.** A courier cannot cancel an order. State changes are written onto the order row and into `outbox_events`; there is no separate status-history table.
>
> On create, `expires_at` is set to now plus one hour (`ORDER_TTL` in `order-service/app/messaging.py`). `order-worker` sweeps every 10 seconds (`EXPIRY_SWEEP_SECONDS`) and calls `expire_overdue_orders`.

Prompt 2 (2026-11-10 10:54 +08:00):

```

Key response 2:

> Because I only had view access. When I opened your link, Canva showed "Viewing" with a "Sign up" button, which means the browser I control isn't signed in to any Canva account. An edit link only works for a signed-in account that the deck has been shared with as an editor, so I could look at the slides but not change them.

Prompt 1 (2026-11-10 22:34 +08:00):

```text
how does the DLQ work
```

Key response 1:

> There are two dead-letter queues (DLQs), one in each service. Each one catches messages its service couldn't process from the other service's topic. Both follow the same rule: **the consumer only commits a Kafka offset after the message has either been applied to the database or been confirmed written to the DLQ.** That way a failing message never blocks its partition, and it is never silently dropped.

Prompt 2 (2026-11-10 22:46 +08:00):

```text
once service is back up what happens?
```

Key response 2:

> The answer depends on which dependency was down. Nothing in the DLQs is ever replayed automatically. Recovery only happens for messages that were held back: parked in Postgres, or left uncommitted in Kafka.
>
> **Order Service catches up on its own.** Its worker never stopped. Each loop it kept trying two relays, both failing and logging `relay_failed`:
> - the outbox relay, which publishes order events;
> - `relay_parked_once`, which moves parked rows onto the DLQ.
