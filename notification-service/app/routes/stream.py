"""Live notification stream (Server-Sent Events).

Each stream subscribes to the process's hub, then finds its starting point,
before the response headers are sent, so a notification committed at any
point after that wakes it. When woken, it sends
the caller's rows with ``id > last_sent_id`` in id order and advances
``last_sent_id``, so each row is sent once however many wake-ups arrive.

Ids are assigned when rows are inserted, so this relies on each recipient's
rows with lower ids committing first. The worker takes a per-recipient advisory
lock before inserting a recipient's rows and holds it until commit, so each
recipient's rows commit in id order and several workers are safe.
